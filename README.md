Safeguard your PHP code by wrapping function declarations in `if (!function_exists())` blocks.

Ensures that functions are only declared if they do not already exist, preventing redeclaration conflicts.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require ghostwriter/handrail
```

### Example

Before running Handrail:

```php
<?php

function exampleFunction() {
    // some code
}

function anotherFunction() {
    // more code
}
```

After running Handrail:

```php
<?php

if (!function_exists('exampleFunction')) {
    function exampleFunction() {
        // some code
    }
}

if (!function_exists('anotherFunction')) {
    function anotherFunction() {
        // more code
    }
}
```

### Configuration

To configure the paths or files to scan, create a composer `extra` configuration in your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "ghostwriter/handrail": {
            "disable": false,
            "packages": [
                "vendor/package"
            ],
            "files": [
                "vendor/amphp/amp/src/functions.php",
                "relative/path/to/file.php"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

- **`disable`**: (default: `false`) A boolean flag to enable or disable Handrail.
- **`files`**: (default: `[]`) An array of files to scan for function declarations.
- **`packages`**: (default: `[]`) An array of Composer packages to scan for function declarations.

## Usage

After installing and configuring Handrail, we will automatically hook into Composer‚Äôs lifecycle events (`post-install-cmd` and `post-update-cmd`) after Composer installs or updates packages.

```bash
composer install
```

```bash
composer update
```

### Manual Execution

You can also run Handrail manually using the following Composer command:

```bash
composer handrail
```

## Advanced Usage
